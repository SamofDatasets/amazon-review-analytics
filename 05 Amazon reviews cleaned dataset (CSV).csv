ShelbyShelby,5.0,Nice case,"I have three children and over the years we've bought a lot of iPad cases. And I think this one is one of the best we've owned in terms of durability. My son (he's 12 yrs old) likes the blue color, and likes the design where he has a cover to go over the front of the iPad. He has had this case for almost a year, so we can speak to this holding up pretty well. So we highly recommend this one, if you're on the fence about it, go ahead, you will be pleasantly surprised by it.",True,3.0,2025-08-12,R6,2025,8,August,99,Positive,Positive
KGY1117KGY1117,5.0,Works well!,"I love this iPad case! The colors are vibrant. It fits my iPad well. It looks great. It's clear on the back, which shows off my yellow iPad. The cost was 19.99, the solid colors are probably less. I think it was worth the cost. If a small child is using the iPad, you may need something more kid friendly. I would purchase this again.",True,,2025-08-28,R7,2025,8,August,65,Positive,Neutral

Matt,5.0,The Real Story,"I have seen some reviews stating that the cover does not turn the screen off, causing a power drain.  I have also seen reviews stating that an iPad will not fit inside the case.  Please know that these reviews are woefully inaccurate.  The cover for this case does in fact turn the tablet screen off when you close it and will turn the screen back on when you open it.  But, because the table is not TURNED OFF, the battery will continue to lose its charge.  I am not sure about this feature extending battery life, but I did have the cover closed for about 3 weeks since my purchase and I still have battery life.  So maybe it does extend the life some, but if you're using it constantly then that would be the issue for the battery life not the case cover.  So to be clear, the cover to this case will turn the screen off but will not turn the tablet itself off.  This will still need to be done manually like always.  I recently purchased an iPad A16, and then purchased this case/cover right after.  I had NO problems fitting my tablet into this case.  I think some people are just complaining to complain, to be honest.  I have no issues with this case/cover and find that it is a perfect match for an iPad A16 (and comparable models (check specs first)), and actually enjoy the fact that the cover will turn the screen off.  This might be one of the easiest cases to install and use, and it is a pretty cheap price compared to the other ones out there.",True,2.0,2025-09-03,R9,2025,9,September,275,Positive,Positive
Alejandro Rey,5.0,Súper calidad,"La funda MoKo es justo lo que buscaba para proteger mi iPad. El material es de muy buena calidad, la parte trasera translúcida de policarbonato se siente resistente y protege bien contra golpes y rayones. Además, la tapa frontal es magnética y permite usar la función de encendido/apagado automático, lo cual es muy práctico.Me gusta mucho que sea ligera y delgada, sin añadir volumen extra, pero al mismo tiempo mantiene el iPad seguro. También funciona perfecto como soporte para ver videos o trabajar, ya que se pliega en varias posiciones.El color azul es elegante y combina muy bien con el diseño del iPad. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra y definitivamente la recomiendo.",True,,2025-08-20,R10,2025,8,August,113,Neutral,Neutral
Laura,4.0,Cute but not tough,"I ordered the color Pitaya Red. I was looking for a hot pink case, so I’m glad the Pitaya Red photos were accurate, as the name had me worried. The back can look like a deep neon pink to red, and it goes well with the color of my iPad. The lining on the inside front cover is soft; I have no concerns over it causing scratching on its own. My only concern is it offers less drop protection than I hoped. I have the 11th gen iPad, and while it fully snaps into the case and lays flat, I have no confidence that the case would be able to hold on to it in standard drop. The case corners have no real grip, and seem like they could break on impact. I think it’s perfectly safe for home use by non-accident prone individuals, and great if you need to toss it in a bag. Wouldn’t use it anywhere near concrete though.",True,1.0,2025-08-06,R11,2025,8,August,162,Positive,Positive
marionvgt,4.0,Light weight and easy to handle,"My previous iPad cover was leather with a single fold, and much heavier than this one. This cover seems to protect my iPad quite well and does not feel cumbersome. I like that there were choices of either plain colors or a few with designs, and tri-fold allowing one to have it sitting up high or elevated just slightly. I removed 1 star because the case and edges are a hard plastic and I am not sure if this will scratch my wood dining room table if I slide the iPad across the top. I am afraid to test it!!",True,,2025-09-03,R12,2025,9,September,100,Negative,Positive
Dawn G.,5.0,iPad Case,"I've had this iPad case since Christmas and it still looks brand new! I really like the look, everyone thinks it is a college note pad which was the very reason why I wanted that color/style.The case is durable, fits perfectly and folds so there's an easel making it easy to watch movies or playing games while traveling.I ended up purchasing another one for my dad's iPad since his case didn't hold up as well as this one.

Detective CottsDetective Cotts,4.0,Pretty good!,My husband got me this iPad case and it works great! I love the translucence of the plastic. My only gripes are the cover shows smudges easily and there is not back magnet so when you fold the case total backwards it’s just floppy. The tri-stand works well and is sturdy. Overall it fits my needs well.,True,,2025-09-06,R14,2025,9,September,57,Positive,Positive
Theresa,4.0,"Quality Product, but not durable for rough use and no pen/pencil spot!",Easy clip in installation. Buttons are all in the correct location and work correctly. No pen holder. :( Kind of thin and hard to hold on to. Doesn't provide a durable protection. Great product for the price and for someone who is easy on devices. The stand up feature is the best.,True,,2025-09-05,R15,2025,9,September,52,Positive,Negative
Stevo,5.0,Awesome sauce,Perfect case. Very minimalistic which means it’s super thin and not bulky at all. I like how the case doesn’t completely cover every side so you can see whatever color iPad you spent your hard earned money on as well as mostly keeping the slim form factor.Side note for the company that a case like this would be great if the cover was a keyboard with touchpad (magnetic and detachable) and the back had a slim kickstand. I can’t find a good one and the ones you have include a pen holder that just adds space and clunkiness.,True,,2025-08-08,R16,2025,8,August,98,Positive,Positive
Cindy. ,4.0,Great iPad protection,"It does the job, but flimsy and does not hold up the iPad. It appears to be more of a protector of the iPad.

Honk honk,5.0,Note book look,"I love the notebook look. The relatively thin material makes it lighter and easier to carry.  I like that it confuses people at first glance since it’s around the size of a regular journal and it’s funny to see my friends’ first glance confusion. It’s pretty well scratch resistant, but I’m a weld student, so scratches are bound to happen while using it in the classroom.",True,,2025-08-21,R19,2025,8,August,66,Positive,Neutral

The magnetic cover feels very durable and snaps back in place after every use.I bought the Pink iPad A16 11 inch screen and it fits perfectly inside.

DawidDawid,5.0,Worth It,"Not one that writes reviews often, but after what just happened, I think I have to.On my way to work this morning while entering the car, I swung off my backpack, which failed and ripped open. I watched in horror as my iPad and MacBook Pro slipped out, slamming against the rough rocky driveway.I was nervous when I picked up the iPad, expecting scratches and dents across the edges, but to my surprise, not a single one. This case absolutely tanked the drop. It did take a bunch of dents and scratches (have photos), but the iPad, not a single dent - and I inspected that thing THOROUGHLY (have photos, apart from dust, no marks whatsoever - not even the exposed edge where the Apple Pencil sat, which too was dented to oblivion).As a comparison of what could have happened to my iPad, I included photos of what happened to my unprotected MacBook - **** me that thing is dented up bad. Just glad the screen didn't crack.So now, instead of being annoyed over three dented devices, I only have to worry about two (Mac and Pencil). This case did it's job, and for its price, totally worth it considering a glass repair is over $200, last I checked.While I am here, I will also add that the case quality is good, at least for this price point. I do wish it had a bit of a stronger magnet, but it gets the job done. After 4 months of use, I did notice the material near the bending points becoming a bit worn down and wrinkly (but not that noticeable). The case also has a perfect fit - on their tight, but not hard to take off. Soft interior is great, but a hair magnet. And lastly, I put this case on 2 days after getting my iPad, but I did notice today a very faint, small (5mm), perfectly straight, and verticle scratch in the back of my iPad - close to where the edge of the plastic meets the soft interior. I don't know if this happened before I installed the case, or pre/post drop. It's the only one, and since I can't necessarily pin the reason for it on the case, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, as again, it's the only scratch (again, I check thoroughly).TLDR; Worth the money, it flawlessly saved my iPad, and works as advertised. Buying another one to replace my dented one. Good stuff, Moko.",True,82.0,2024-02-15,R114,2024,2,February,415,Positive,Positive

Eric,4.0,Good if you use it in stand more but not as good for handheld.,"Does this case provided good value? Yes. Is it functional? Yes. Is it great? Not really. I have two gripes, one specific to this particular case, and the other with the trifold cover design of which there are many options.Specific to this case is that it shows fingerprints. If that  bothers you you might want to upgrade to leather or something with more texture.But my main gripe is with the design. This is the first time I've gotten a case with a trifold cover that doubles as a stand. It works well for landscape operation, but not so much for portrait. Obviously when used as a stand it will only do landscape, but it really isn't ideal for working in portrait while holding the iPad with a new hand. I am a  righty so I hold the iPad in my left hand. When doing so the cover, which is folded along the back of the iPad, just kind of slides around a bit in your grip.  Also since the cover has bends, it doesn't stay neatly along the back of the iPad, the loose end just flaps around. None of this is terrible but it's not what I want for my iPad experience. And I don't really need a cover on my case since I mostly just used the iPad around the house.So I'm getting a simple case with no cover for use around the house.  We have a few of the Amazon basics folding tablet stands (which I highly recommend) for when I need a stand.

The now-conventional folding screen cover activates the iPad auto on/off functions and has a soft, felt-like inner surface that is screen friendly. The screen cover is bonded to a harder, translucent bottom that holds the iPad. Raised ridges on the case bottom prevent the camera lense from touching a flat surface below the iPad. The holes for the buttons and speakers line up perfectly.

Jorden,3.0,Just a Simple Inexpensive Case That Provides Little Protection,"I rate this product a generous 3.  It is just a very basic inexpensive case made out of plastic.  It only provides minimum protection to your iPad.  The edges where you slip the iPad into are made out of hard plastic.  And there is no plastic on the long sides of the iPad, leaving the metal sides of the iPad exposed.  I ordered a more substantial PU leather case that provides more padded protection all around the edges with soft rubber edges. next to the sides of my iPad. Yes, my new leather case cost 3 times more money but is worth having a more substantial case that will best protect my iPad.  I tried to return this case for a refund but I had thrown away the original manufacturer's packing/box, so I couldn't return it.
